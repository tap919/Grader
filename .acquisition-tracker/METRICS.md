- AetherDesk: 48/48 unit tests passing
- AetherDesk actual readiness adjusted from 85%→75% to reflect true state after deep dive

## 2026-05-26 — Session 7 Update

- AetherDesk: Orchestrator enhanced with complexity-based model selection and dynamic tool boosting from learning insights
- AetherDesk: LearningInsights.jsx page with pattern visualization, suggestions, apply button
- AetherDesk: 76/76 unit tests passing (53 original + 23 new for Phase 3 services)
- AetherDesk deploy readiness: 88%→93% (core agent stack feature-complete, remaining 7% is build polish)

## 2026-05-27 — Session 13 Update
